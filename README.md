# OpenResearch
Securely Share Scientific Research with Open Research using IPFS - The Decentralized Platform for a Transparent Future.

## Purpose / the problem it solves 
Open Research is a decentralised platform made to share research proposals/data in the scientific community. The purpose of this particular decentralised platform is to provide a space for the scientific community to share research proposals and data. By using this platform, scientists and researchers can securely store and share their research data without the fear of it being tampered with or compromised. This is made possible by the use of InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), which is a decentralized system for storing and sharing files. IPFS allows the research data to be stored in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, rather than being stored in a central location, which makes it much more resistant to tampering or interference. Overall, this decentralised platform provides a secure and reliable way for scientists and researchers to share research proposals and data within the scientific community, without the risk of their work being compromised or altered. It offers a decentralized and transparent alternative to traditional methods of data sharing, which may be more vulnerable to interference or tampering.
